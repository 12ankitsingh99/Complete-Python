Python provides a rich set of operators to perform various operations on data. Here's a breakdown of common operator types and related concepts, often asked in interviews:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
Used to perform mathematical calculations.

+ (Addition): x + y

- (Subtraction): x - y

* (Multiplication): x * y

/ (Division): x / y (always returns a float)

% (Modulo): x % y (returns the remainder of the division)

** (Exponentiation): x ** y (x raised to the power of y)

// (Floor Division): x // y (returns the integer part of the quotient, rounding down)

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators:
Used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False).

== (Equal to): x == y

!= (Not equal to): x != y

> (Greater than): x > y

< (Less than): x < y

>= (Greater than or equal to): x >= y

<= (Less than or equal to): x <= y

3. Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.

= (Assignment): x = 10

+= (Add and assign): x += 5 (equivalent to x = x + 5)

-= (Subtract and assign): x -= 5 (equivalent to x = x - 5)

*= (Multiply and assign): x *= 5 (equivalent to x = x * 5)

/= (Divide and assign): x /= 5 (equivalent to x = x / 5)

%= (Modulo and assign): x %= 5 (equivalent to x = x % 5)

**= (Exponentiate and assign): x **= 2 (equivalent to x = x ** 2)

//= (Floor divide and assign): x //= 2 (equivalent to x = x // 2)

&= (Bitwise AND and assign)

|= (Bitwise OR and assign)

^= (Bitwise XOR and assign)

>>= (Bitwise right shift and assign)

<<= (Bitwise left shift and assign)

4. Logical Operators:
Used to combine conditional statements.

and: Returns True if both statements are true.

x > 5 and y < 10

or: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.

x > 5 or y < 10

not: Reverses the result, returns False if the result is true.

not(x > 5 and y < 10)

5. Identity Operators:
Used to compare the memory locations of two objects.

is: Returns True if both variables point to the same object in memory.

x is y

is not: Returns True if both variables do not point to the same object in memory.

x is not y

Important Note on == vs. is:

== compares the values of the objects.

is compares the identity (memory address) of the objects.

Python

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1

print(list1 == list2)  # True (values are the same)
print(list1 is list2)  # False (different objects in memory)
print(list1 is list3)  # True (both point to the same object)
6. Membership Operators:
Used to test if a sequence (string, list, tuple, set, dictionary) contains a specified value.

in: Returns True if a value is found in the sequence.

'a' in 'apple'

3 in [1, 2, 3]

not in: Returns True if a value is not found in the sequence.

'z' not in 'apple'

7. Bitwise Operators:
Used to perform operations on individual bits of integers. These are less common in general programming but important in specific domains like low-level programming, encryption, or when optimizing for bit manipulation.

& (AND): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.

| (OR): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the bits is 1.

^ (XOR): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1.

~ (NOT): Inverts all the bits.

<< (Left Shift): Shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros on the right. Equivalent to multiplying by 2 
n
 .

>> (Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right, filling with zeros on the left (for positive numbers). Equivalent to integer division by 2 
n
 .

8. Operator Precedence and Associativity:

Precedence: Determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression (e.g., multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction). Parentheses () can be used to override precedence.

Associativity: Determines the order of evaluation when operators have the same precedence (e.g., most operators are left-associative).

Example: 2 + 3 * 4 will evaluate 3 * 4 first (12), then 2 + 12 (14).

Example: 10 / 2 * 5 will evaluate 10 / 2 first (5), then 5 * 5 (25) because / and * have the same precedence and are left-associative.
